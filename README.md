# CardShuffling

This repository contains code for solving the following problem: 

Begin with a standard deck of 52 cards in any particular order. Next, put the topmost card of the deck on a table and the next topmost card underneath the deck. Repeat this process until the last card in your hand is placed on the deck on the table. This process is counted as one round. Find the number of rounds until you have the cards in the original order.
